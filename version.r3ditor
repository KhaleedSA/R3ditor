<li>GENERAL: Fancy new buttons labeled "Reload RDT", "Reload MSG" and "Reload SAV" are available! - <i>Nice!</i></li>
<li>GENERAL: Now you can open the game while you edit RDT files.<br><i>Yes, i know it was a huge mistake implement this feature without allowing to use it while you edit the files!</i></li><br>
<li>RDT: You can finally edit RDT Messages! - <i>Yaaay!</i> [WIP]<br>
To do that, you need to follow these Rules:<br><br>
1) Do not edit any message that contains <font class="code">(Unknown Char / Function NÂº XX - Hex: XX)</font> - <strong>YOU WILL BREAK YOUR FILE!</strong><br><i>(i warned you!)</i><br><br>
2) You can only save the message if you keep the same size of the original message! <i>(this will change soon)</i><br><br>
<i>Info: some RDT's are still displaying duplicate messages or not showing all the messages properly or all the messages at all.</i></li><br>
<li>RDT: There are new filters to avoid displaying garbage messages!<br><i>(Belive, this will be discarted in the next update!)</i></li>
<li>RDT: For each file you open, a map file will be generated to avoid analyzing the same file all the time and wasting time and processing.<br><i>In short - R3ditor is now working similarly to the RPCS3 emulator!</i></li><br>

<li>MSG: Change text color are now a function, with more colors to choose!</li>
